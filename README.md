# WinFormsMVP
Simple example of MVP pattern (Passive View variant) in WinForms. 

Implementation rather traditional but I found it was the most convenient to create views only in views and presenters only in presenters. Then abstraction of views are passed to primary presenters that creates secondary presenters.

I do not know how I programmed in WinForms without MVP!
